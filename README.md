# UdemyDS-ML

This repository contains projects that I work on while taking the course "Machine Learning in Python: Machine Learning & Data Science" on the educational platform Udemy. You can find the course [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-machine-learning-data-science-russian/).

## About the Course

The course covers various topics in machine learning and data science using Python. It includes both theoretical concepts and practical hands-on projects aimed at applying machine learning algorithms to real-world datasets.

## Projects

- **Project 1: Feature Engineering & Linear Regression**
  
  In this project, I focused on feature engineering, where I constructed new features from existing data to improve the predictive power of machine learning models. Subsequently, I built a machine learning model, specifically linear regression, based on these engineered features.

- **Project 2: Logistic Regression & Model Evaluation**
  
  This project delved into logistic regression, a popular classification algorithm. I trained a logistic regression model on a dataset, performed model evaluation, including confusion matrix analysis, and visualized evaluation metrics such as precision-recall and ROC curves.

- **Project 3: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification**

  The project focuses on implementing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm and evaluating its performance using a Sonar dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

- **Project 4: Support Vector Machines (SVM) for Wine Fraud Detection**

  This project involves implementing Support Vector Machines (SVM) for detecting fraud in wine quality classification. It includes data analysis, preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and result visualization.

- **Project 5: Decision Trees and Random Forests for Telecom Customer Churn Prediction**

  This project focuses on implementing Decision Trees and Random Forests for predicting customer churn in a telecommunications company. It includes data analysis, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and result visualization.

- **Project 6: Natural Language Processing (NLP) Projects**

  This section includes two projects focusing on Natural Language Processing (NLP). Project 1 involves sentiment analysis on airline tweets, while Project 2 focuses on sentiment analysis of movie reviews.

- **Project 7: Country Clustering Analysis**

  This project aims to identify similarities among countries and regions based on various features using clustering analysis. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building using K-Means clustering, and visualization of results on a choropleth map.

- **Project 8: DBSCAN Clustering Analysis**

  This project aims to segment wholesale customers based on purchasing behavior using DBSCAN algorithm. It involves data preprocessing, model building, and visualization.

- **Project 9: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

  This project involves utilizing Principal Component Analysis to determine which handwritten digits differ most significantly from each other. It includes data exploration, visualization, preprocessing, PCA application, and result analysis.
