# UdemyDS-ML

This repository contains projects that I work on while taking the course "Machine Learning in Python: Machine Learning & Data Science" on the educational platform Udemy. You can find the course [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-machine-learning-data-science-russian/).

## About the Course

The course covers various topics in machine learning and data science using Python. It includes both theoretical concepts and practical hands-on projects aimed at applying machine learning algorithms to real-world datasets.

## Projects

- **Project 1: Feature Engineering & Linear Regression**
  
  In this project, I focused on feature engineering, where I constructed new features from existing data to improve the predictive power of machine learning models. Subsequently, I built a machine learning model, specifically linear regression, based on these engineered features.

- **Project 2: Logistic Regression & Model Evaluation**
  
  This project delved into logistic regression, a popular classification algorithm. I trained a logistic regression model on a dataset, performed model evaluation, including confusion matrix analysis, and visualized evaluation metrics such as precision-recall and ROC curves.

## Requirements

To run the projects in this repository, you will need Python installed on your system along with the necessary libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. Instructions for setting up the environment and installing dependencies can be found in the README files of each project folder.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the projects, simply navigate to the corresponding project folder and follow the instructions provided in the README file.
