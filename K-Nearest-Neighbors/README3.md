# Project: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification

This project focuses on implementing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm and evaluating its performance. KNN is a simple and effective supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains response metrics for 60 different sonar frequencies sent out by a sonar device, which are then labeled as either "mine" or "rock". Each sample in the dataset represents the pattern of sonar returns for a particular object (mine or rock) under different frequencies.

## Project Structure

The project directory includes:

- Python code files for implementing KNN algorithm, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- Plots directory containing visualization plots:
  - `heatmap_corr`: Heatmap of correlation matrix for feature analysis.
  - `plot`: Plot showing the relationship between the number of neighbors (K) and model accuracy.
  - `heatmap_confusion_matrix`: Heatmap representation of the confusion matrix.
- Data directory containing the Sonar dataset (`sonar.all-data.csv`).
- README.md providing project information and instructions.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Explore the Python code files for implementing KNN, data preprocessing, and model evaluation.
5. Review the visualization plots in the `plots` directory.
6. Examine the Sonar dataset file (`sonar.all-data.csv`) to understand the data structure.
7. Run the Python scripts to train the KNN model and evaluate its performance.

## Requirements

To run the code in this project, you will need Python installed on your system along with the required libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. You can install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt```
